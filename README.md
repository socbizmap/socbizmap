- Purpose and objectives of the project
Our goal is to create a mobile application that will make your job search as easy as possible. Allows people to find work near the place where they live. People will be able to find temporary part-time jobs, be notified of new offers that appear in a given range. We create each user his story, recorded in the blockchain, which will allow specialists in their field to find work quickly even after changing their place of residence. People will communicate and search for employees without third-party legacy sites and intermediaries. It is enough to put a mark on the map in the application about what you need or what you can and instantly everyone who needs your services will see you, and most importantly, you will be very convenient for them, as you will be next to them! We create Amazon in the service sector!

Let me give you an example. If a tile laying master changes his place of residence, then he just needs to change his mark on the map and all new residents around will know that there is such a master nearby, they will be able to go to his portfolio and view his work done, view photos and videos recorded in blockchain in the form of NTF, read reviews and comments. By reviewing previous orders, you can easily determine whether such an employee is right for you.

Blockchain and token
And so we create an international mobile application, the basis of which is based on the blockchain. All transactions between people will be recorded on the blockchain. One of the main instruments of trust is our token with which it will be possible to pay for work. All transactions are smart contracts, where there is no outside interference in the transaction process. The contractor is guaranteed to receive his earned funds for the performance of work.
How it works: for example, you want to hire a tiler to move the tiles in the bathroom, you open the mobile application, put a mark on the map where it needs to be done, upload a photo or video explaining what to do. All specialist tilers receive a notification from the application that there is such a job. After communicating with the customer and upon agreement on the amount of payment, an agreement MAY (this is not necessary) be signed in the form of a smart contract. The procedure is as follows: the contractor in the application clicks on the «accept the order» button, and at this time the customer has a «confirm the contractor» button and a field for entering the transaction amount, then the customer sets the order amount and clicks the confirm the contractor button. The contractor is asked to confirm the set amount of the service. After all participants have confirmed the amount, this amount will be debited from the customer’s account and frozen until the order is completed. After the order is completed, the contractor uploads a photo or video with the completed work. The customer receives a notification that the work has been completed, after which the customer must click on the «confirm» button, and at this moment the contractor will receive funds credited to his account in the account. If the customer does not confirm and rejects the execution of the order, then arbitration may be appointed here, the arbitration process will be described in the appendix.
During the payment process, people will not transfer money to each other, the money will be automatically transferred to a token, and through a smart contract these tokens will be transferred to the performer’s balance, where, in turn, upon withdrawal of funds, they will be converted into real money.
